Programming Assignment 1: Percolation


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe how you implemented Percolation.java. How did you check
 *  whether the system percolates?
 *****************************************************************************/



/******************************************************************************
 *  Using Percolation with QuickFindUF.java,  fill in the table below such that 
 *  the N values are multiples of each other.

 *  Give a formula (using tilde notation) for the running time (in seconds) of 
 *  PercolationStats.java as a function of both N and T. Be sure to give both 
 *  the coefficient and exponent of the leading term. Your coefficients should 
 *  be based on empirical data and rounded to two significant digits, such as 
 *  5.3*10^-8 * N^5.0 T^1.5.

/**********************************************************************
 *  How much memory (in bytes) does a Percolation object (which uses

 *  After reading the course collaboration policy, answer the

1. How much help can you give a fellow student taking COS 226?
(a) None. Only the preceptors and lab TAs can help.
(b) You can discuss ideas and concepts but students can get help
    debugging their code only from a preceptor, lab TA, or
    student who has already passed COS 226.
(c) You can help a student by discussing ideas, selecting data
    structures, and debugging their code.
(d) You can help a student by emailing him/her your code.

2. What are the rules when partnering?
 (a) You and your partner must both be present while writing code.
     But after that only one person needs to do the analysis.
 (b) You and your partner must both be present while writing code
     and during the analysis, but, after that, only one person
     needs to be present while submitting the code and the
     readme.
 (c) You and your partner must both be present while writing code,
     during the analysis, and while submitting the code and the
     readme. Failure to do so is a violation of the course
     collaboration policy.

3. For any programming assignment, I am permitted to use code that
   I found on a website other than the COS 226 or algs4 website
   (e.g., on GitHub or StackOverflow):
 (a) Only when the online code was written by a person who does not
     and did not go to Princeton.
 (b) Only when the online code implemented different assignment
     specifications than the ones I'm currently working on.
 (c) Always, because online code is available to everyone.
 (d) Never, because such websites are an impermissible "outside 
     source".
