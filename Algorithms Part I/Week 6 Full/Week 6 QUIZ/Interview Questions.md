### Interview Questions: Hash Tables (ungraded)
TOTAL POINTS 2
##### Question 1
#### 4-SUM. <br />
Given an array  a[] of n integers, the 4-SUM problem is to determine if there exist distinct indices i, j, k, and l such that a[i] + a[j] = a[k] + a[l]. 
Design an algorithm for the 4-SUM problem that takes time proportional to n^2 (under suitable technical assumptions).<br /><br />

##### Question 2
#### Hashing with wrong hashCode() or equals(). <br />
Suppose that you implement a data type OlympicAthlete for use in a java.util.HashMap. <br />
 * Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but not equals(). <br />
 * Describe what happens if you override equals() but not hashCode(). <br />
 * Describe what happens if you override hashCode() but implement public boolean equals(OlympicAthlete that) instead of  public boolean equals(Object that).
