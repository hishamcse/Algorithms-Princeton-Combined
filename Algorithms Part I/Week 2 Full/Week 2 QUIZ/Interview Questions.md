### Interview Questions: Stacks and Queues (ungraded)
TOTAL POINTS 3
##### Question 1
#### Queue with two stacks. <br />
Implement a queue with two stacks so that each queue operations takes a constant amortized number of stack operations. <br /><br />

##### Question 2
#### Stack with max. <br />
Create a data structure that efficiently supports the stack operations (push and pop) and also a return-the-maximum operation. Assume the elements are real numbers so that you can compare them. <br /><br />

##### Question 3
#### Java generics. <br />
Explain why Java prohibits generic array creation. <br /><br /><br />


### Interview Questions: Elementary Sorts (ungraded)
TOTAL POINTS 3
##### Question 1
#### Intersection of two sets. <br /> 
Given two arrays a[] and b[], each containing n distinct 2D points in the plane, design a subquadratic algorithm to count the number of points that are contained both in array a[] and array b[]. <br /><br />

##### Question 2
#### Permutation. <br />
Given two integer arrays of size n, design a subquadratic algorithm to determine whether one is a permutation of the other. That is, do they contain exactly the same entries but, possibly, in a different order. <br /><br />

##### Question 3
#### Dutch national flag. <br />
Given an array of n buckets, each containing a red, white, or blue pebble, sort them by color. The allowed operations are: <br />

 * swap(i, j) :  swap the pebble in bucket i with the pebble in bucket j. <br />
 * color(i) :  determine the color of the pebble in bucket i. <br />
 
The performance requirements are as follows: <br />

 * At most n calls to color(). <br />
 * At most n calls to swap(). <br />
 * Constant extra space. <br />
